# Heap

A binary heap is a binary tree in which every node's children is less or equal than the node's data. (Max-heap)

A heap is typically implemented using a dynamic array, the first position is empty.

Left child of a node = 2n
Right child of a node = 2n+1

Where n is the index of the current node.
