# AVL Tree

Avl tree is a self balancing tree, this means that its height is h=logn

So now most operations are guaranteed to be O(logn)

A balanced tree is one in which the difference between the height of left subtree and right subtree is max 1.

Each node has a balance factor, this is the difference we talked before. When a node exceeds the balance factor to be > 1, it has to be rebalanced.
